# ESP-Snippets: Smart Campus Temperature Monitoring System

Welcome to the ESP-Snippets project! This project is part of the IEEE Student Branch initiative aimed at developing a smart campus system. The goal of this project is to create a system using ESP32 microcontrollers to monitor the temperature of lecture rooms and report the data to a central node.

## Introduction

The Smart Campus Temperature Monitoring System is designed to improve the comfort and energy efficiency of lecture rooms by continuously monitoring their temperature. The system uses ESP32 microcontrollers to collect temperature data and send it to a central node (Red Node) for analysis and reporting.

## Features

- Real-time temperature monitoring of multiple lecture rooms
- Wireless data transmission using ESP32 microcontrollers
- Centralized data collection and reporting
- Easy installation and setup

## Hardware Requirements

To set up the Smart Campus Temperature Monitoring System, you will need the following hardware components:

- ESP32 microcontrollers (one for each lecture room)
- DHT11 temperature sensors
- Door sensors
- Red Node (central node for data collection)
- Wi-Fi network for communication

## Usage

Once the system is set up, the ESP32 microcontrollers will start monitoring the temperature of the lecture rooms and send the data to the central node. The central node will collect and report the data for analysis.
